# Mighty Card Game
The card game Mighty is said to have been invented by Korean college students in the mid 1970's, but it is closely related to the group of Japanese picture capturing games, especially Napoleon (Japanese Card Game), which date back to the beginning of the 20th century. Mighty is played mostly by current or former students in Korea, and it is known there by the English sounding name "Mighty".

Mighty is a point-trick game with bidding. In each hand the high bidder chooses a partner by calling a card, and these two players try to take enough of the scoring cards (A, K, Q, J, 10) to fulfill the bid. 

This project solved the problem of getting five people in the same room, which has proved difficult on many occasions. The solution was to make the game accessible online.

# Noire Rose Codex
Noire rose means black rose or black pink in French.

This project allows users to solve the 4, 5, and 6-Letter Codex in six tries. Each guess must be a valid word in the Codex's word bank. NoireRose Codex will color-code the letters after each guess to indicate how close your guess is to the Codex. Attempt the 4-Letter Codex to get the 5-Letter Codex. Solve the 5-Letter Codex to get the 6-Letter Codex. Everyone gets the same Codex every day and resets every midnight. 

## Features
- Color-coded letters to help solve the codex and playable in light & dark mode<br/>
